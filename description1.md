# Timer microbit program

* In this program I created a Timer in which you can increment the timer using button A and the counter counts down at the push of button B.

* Pressing A+B will stop the counter.

* I used two if statements for the countdown. One for if B is pressed then the counter counts down and another for when the timer reaches 0 to stop the timer.
